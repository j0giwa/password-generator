## Development goals

The goal is to generate a random string based on parameters.

I might add a GUI either with Python or GTK
after the main binary is functional.


## Install
 
The current way of installing it is via the MakeFile

```sh
make
```
The binary is placed in the bin/ directory of the project files.
Since the project is in a veeery early stage of development, it does not do much 


## Usage
 
The current version is in a veeery early stage of development, so it does not do much.
Running the binary will print some debugvalues to stdout.


## Disclaimer

Since this is my first project written in C,
It won't be as well structured or usable as the projects made by seasoned developers,
however I will do my best.
