# password-generator

An educational project,
to teach myself the C programming language.

The goal is to generate a random string based on parameters.

Since this is my first project written in C,
It won't be as well structured or usable as the projects made by seasoned developers,
however I will do my best.

Might add a GUI either with Python or GTK
after the C code works.
