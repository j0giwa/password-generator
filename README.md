# password-generator

An educationional project,
to teach myself th C programing language.

The goal is to generate a random string 
based on parameters.

Since this is my first project written in C,
It won't be as well structured or usable as
the repos made by seasoned developers,
however I will do my best.


Might add a GUI either with Python or GTK
after the C code works.
